# Sheet-Music-Reader
Plays audio from sheet music

Input the filename of sheet music picture and desired tempo. Current PictureReader.java is set to use notes from notelibrary, so if you want different key or instrument, you'll have to use a different library of notes. 

You can use the sheet music pictures in the "examples" directory to test it.
