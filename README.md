# Sheet-Music-Reader
By Katrina Lee

To play audio of sheet music, run PictureReader.java on the filename of sheet music picture and desired tempo. Current PictureReader.java is set to use notes from notelibrary, so if you want different key or instrument, you'll have to use a different library of notes. 

Note that the program currently accepts treble clef music of quarter notes in C major or A minor, and the picture should not include a time or key signature.  You can use the sheet music pictures in the "examples" directory to test it.
